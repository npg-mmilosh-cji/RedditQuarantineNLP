The real culprits are an educational system that endorses feeling and emotion over fact and, media that encourages the same. The children have been lied to and told the universe came from \"nothingness\" and will return to \"nothingness\", that they are \"nothing but advanced primates\" and truth is a \"social construct\".

Only courses that mean anything in school is STEAM and basics which you only learn once and why learn year after year? I hate ELA I know English reading writing talking hearing so why do I have to keep taking it? Waste of class. Very little choice in school.

The ATF still has files on registered serial numbers which are searchable, only, they trace back to the origin of the weapon (the store) not an individual. The ATF must then use those files or obtain store records to get purchase history. Private sales are kind of like private sales of anything, but the ATF has a policy of live and let live with single point (single firearm) sales.

Intersex people may show characteristics of both genders but it is biologically impossible for a human to be fertile as both a male and female simultaneously. While it may be difficult to determine at birth which gender is more pronounced in an exceedingly rare portion of the human race, eventually that person will exhibit fertility associated with either the male or female gender.
